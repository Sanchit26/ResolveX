# 🧪 Test Admin Dashboard Database Updates

This guide will help you verify that ALL complaint updates from the admin dashboard are properly saved to MongoDB Atlas.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### The Problem:
- Admin dashboard was using `trackingId` (like GR518582ZTBEMB) to update complaints
- MongoDB API needs the internal `_id` (like 68eac1dfbd735f97ed8b3127)
- Updates were failing silently

### The Solution:
- ✅ Now stores both `trackingId` (for display) and `_id` (for database updates)
- ✅ Uses correct `_id` when making API calls
- ✅ Shows success/error messages
- ✅ Logs all actions to browser console
- ✅ Refreshes data after each update to confirm changes

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Your App
```bash
cd /Users/syedasif/COMPLAINT-RAISE-SYSTEM-main
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Admin Dashboard
Go to: **http://localhost:3000/admin**

### Step 3: Open Browser Console
Press **F12** or **Cmd+Option+I** (Mac) to see logs

## 🎯 Test Case 1: Update Complaint Status

### Test: Change Pending → In Progress

1. **Find a Pending complaint** in the table (yellow badge)
2. **Click on it** to open the modal
3. **In the modal:**
   - Change status dropdown to "In Progress"
   - Add notes: "Started investigating this issue"
   - Click "Update Complaint"
4. **Check console** - You should see:
   ```
   Updating complaint GR518582ZTBEMB (MongoDB ID: 68eac1dfbd735f97ed8b3127) to status: In Progress
   ✓ Complaint updated successfully: {success: true, ...}
   ```
5. **Check the alert** - Should say: "✓ Complaint GR518582ZTBEMB updated to In Progress"
6. **Check the table** - Badge should now be blue (In Progress)

### Verify in Database:
```bash
# Open MongoDB Atlas dashboard
# Or use mongo shell to check
```

## 🎯 Test Case 4: Forward to Different Department

### Test: Move complaint to another department

1. **Click any complaint**
2. **In the modal:**
   - Keep status the same
   - Change "Forward to Department" dropdown to different department (e.g., "Technical Support")
   - Add notes: "This should be handled by tech team"
   - Click "Update Complaint"
3. **Check console:**
   ```
   Forwarding complaint GR518582ZTBEMB (MongoDB ID: 68eac1dfbd735f97ed8b3127) to: Technical Support
   ✓ Complaint forwarded successfully
   ```
4. **Check alert** for confirmation
5. **Department column should update** in the table

---

## 🎯 Test Case 5: Multiple Updates at Once

### Test: Change both status AND department

1. **Click any complaint**
2. **In the modal:**
   - Change status to "In Progress"
   - Change department to "Billing"
   - Add notes: "Moving to billing and starting work"
   - Click "Update Complaint"
3. **Should see 2 console logs:**
   - One for status update
   - One for department forward
4. **Both should succeed**
5. **Table should refresh** showing both changes

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

After each update, you should see:

1. ✅ **Console log** with MongoDB ID and success message
2. ✅ **Success alert** popup
3. ✅ **Table updates** immediately
4. ✅ **Badge color changes** (if status changed)
5. ✅ **Department updates** (if forwarded)
6. ✅ **Page refreshes** data from server

## 🔍 Verify in MongoDB Atlas

### Method 1: MongoDB Atlas Dashboard

1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Click "Browse Collections"
3. Find "cpgrams" database → "complaints" collection
4. Search for the complaint you updated (by tracking ID)
5. Check the fields:
   - `status` should match what you set
   - `department` should match if forwarded
   - `adminReply` should contain your notes
   - `updatedAt` should be recent

### Method 2: API Endpoint

```bash
# Get all complaints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/complaints

# Get specific complaint by MongoDB ID
curl http://localhost:3000/api/complaints/68eac1dfbd735f97ed8b3127
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Alert says "❌ Error: Failed to update"

**Check:**
1. Is MongoDB connected? (Look for "✓ Connected to MongoDB" in terminal)
2. Is the main app running on port 3000?
3. Check browser console for detailed error
4. Check main app terminal for API errors

### Issue: Status changes but doesn't persist after refresh

**Check:**
1. Look at browser console for "✓ Complaint updated successfully"
2. If you see errors, MongoDB might not be connected
3. Whitelist your IP in MongoDB Atlas

### Issue: No console logs appearing

**Check:**
1. Make sure browser console is open (F12)
2. Try a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Clear browser cache

## 📊 Test All Statuses

Create a checklist and test each transition:

### From Pending:
- [x] Pending → In Progress
- [x] Pending → Resolved
- [x] Pending → Rejected

### From In Progress:
- [x] In Progress → Resolved
- [x] In Progress → Rejected
- [x] In Progress → Pending (go back)

### From Resolved:
- [x] Resolved → In Progress (reopen)

### From Rejected:
- [x] Rejected → In Progress (reconsider)
