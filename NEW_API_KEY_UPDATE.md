## ⚠️ If Still Getting Quota Errors

This means the **new key also needs credits**:

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview
2. Add payment method
3. Add $5-10 in credits
4. Test again

## ✅ Your Chatbot Works Either Way

Even without OpenAI credits:
- ✅ Tracks complaints (MongoDB)
- ✅ Shows statistics
- ✅ Department info
- ✅ Filing guidance

With credits:
- 🚀 AI-powered natural conversations
- 🚀 Contextual responses
- 🚀 Complex query understanding
