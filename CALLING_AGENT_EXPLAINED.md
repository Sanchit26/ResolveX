# 📞 Calling Agent - Complete Guide

## 🎯 What Is the Calling Agent?

The "calling agent" folder contains **Vocode** - an AI-powered **voice calling system** that allows users to **speak with an AI over the phone** instead of typing in a chatbot!

### What It Does:
- 🎙️ **Voice Conversations** - Users can call a phone number and speak with AI
- 🤖 **AI-Powered** - Uses ChatGPT to have intelligent conversations
- ☎️ **Telephony Integration** - Works with Twilio/Vonage for real phone calls
- 🔊 **Voice Recognition** - Transcribes speech to text
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech** - Converts AI responses to voice
- 📱 **Real Phone Calls** - Not web-based, actual phone calls!

## 🔍 Current Setup Analysis

### Technology Stack:
1. **Language:** Python (not JavaScript/Next.js!)
2. **Framework:** FastAPI (web framework)
3. **AI:** OpenAI ChatGPT
4. **Telephony:** Twilio (phone service)
5. **Voice:** Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech
6. **Tunneling:** ngrok (for local development)
7. **Database:** Redis (for configuration)

### Main Components:

#### 1. Telephony App (`apps/telephony_app/`)
- Main phone calling application
- Handles incoming/outgoing calls
- Integrates with Twilio

#### 2. LangChain Agent (`apps/langchain_agent/`)
- Advanced AI conversation management
- Can use custom tools and actions
- More sophisticated than basic ChatGPT

#### 3. LiveKit (`apps/livekit/`)
- WebRTC-based voice communication
- For web-based voice calls (not phone)

#### 4. Voice RAG (`apps/voice_rag/`)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Can answer questions from a knowledge base

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Why It's Not Simple to Add a Button:

1. **Different Technology:**
   - Your app: Next.js (JavaScript)
   - Calling agent: Python
   - They are **separate applications**

2. **Requires Phone Service:**
   - Needs Twilio account ($$$)
   - Needs phone number
   - Not free like chatbot

3. **Requires Separate Server:**
   - Must run Python server separately
   - Cannot run inside Next.js

4. **Complex Setup:**
   - Multiple services needed
   - Environment variables
   - External dependencies

---

## 🚫 Current Status: NOT WORKING

The calling agent is currently **NOT configured or running** because:

1. ❌ No Twilio credentials set up
2. ❌ No phone number configured
3. ❌ Python environment not set up
4. ❌ Not integrated with your Next.js app
5. ❌ No server running

---

## 🛠️ How to Make It Work

### Option A: Full Phone Integration (Complex, Costs Money)

#### Requirements:
- Twilio account (paid service)
- Phone number ($1+/month)
- Python 3.10+
- Redis server
- ngrok account

#### Setup Steps:

1. **Get Twilio Account:**
   ```
   1. Sign up at https://www.twilio.com
   2. Buy a phone number (~$1/month)
   3. Get Account SID and Auth Token
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd "calling agent"
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in calling agent/apps/telephony_app/
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_ngrok_token
   ```

4. **Start Redis:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
   ```

5. **Run Telephony Server:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/telephony_app
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Configure Twilio:**
   - Point Twilio webhook to ngrok URL
   - Users can call the Twilio number
   - AI answers and converses!

**Cost:** ~$1-5/month + per-minute charges

### Option B: Web-Based Voice (Simpler, Free)

Instead of phone calls, add **web-based voice** to your app (like voice messages on WhatsApp).

#### Advantages:
- ✅ No phone service needed
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Easier integration
- ✅ Works in browser

#### How It Would Work:
```
User clicks button → Records voice → Sends to API → AI responds with voice
```

## 💡 Recommended Solution: Add Voice Input to Chatbot

Instead of a separate calling agent, I recommend **enhancing your existing chatbot** with voice capabilities:

### Features:
1. 🎙️ Click mic button to speak
2. 🗣️ Voice is transcribed to text
3. 💬 Chatbot responds in text (or voice)
4. 📱 Works in browser, no phone needed
5. 🆓 Free to use!

### Benefits:
- Same chatbot interface
- No external phone service
- No additional costs
- Easy to implement
- Better user experience

## 🎨 How to Add Voice Button (Like Chatbot)

Let me create a voice-enabled complaint button similar to the chatbot:

### New Feature: "Voice Complaint" Button

```
[💬 Chat]  [🎙️ Voice Call]  [📝 File Complaint]
```

This will:
- Open a modal (like chatbot)
- Record user's voice
- Transcribe to text
- Show as complaint form
- User can edit and submit

**Implementation:** Next section...

---

## 🚀 What I'll Implement

### Option 1: Voice Complaint Button (Recommended)
- Click button → Record voice → Transcribe → Fill complaint form
- Uses Web Speech API (built into browser)
- No external services needed
- Free and easy!

### Option 2: Voice Chat Button
- Click button → Speak with AI → Get responses
- Uses your OpenAI key
- Voice input + text responses
- Or text + voice responses

### Option 3: Full Phone Integration
- Requires Twilio setup
- Provides actual phone number
- Users can call from any phone
- More complex, costs money

---

## 🤔 Which Option Do You Want?

### 🥇 I RECOMMEND: Option 1 (Voice Complaint Button)
**Why?**
- Easiest to implement
- Free
- No external dependencies
- Great user experience
- Works in browser
- Like voice messages

### Looks Like:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐

│                                  │
│  "I have a problem with my      │
│   delivery. It was supposed to  │
│   arrive yesterday but hasn't   │
│   come yet. My order number     │
│   is 12345..."                  │
│                                  │
│  [Stop] [Submit] [Cancel]       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
