# ⚠️ OpenAI Quota Exceeded - Action Required

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ QUOTA EXCEEDED

---

## 🎯 Real Issue Found

The API key **IS working correctly**, but your OpenAI account has exceeded its quota.

### Error Details:

RateLimitError: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

## 🛡️ Temporary Workaround (Until You Add Credits)

Your chatbot already has intelligent fallback responses! It will work without OpenAI by:

1. **Tracking Complaints**: MongoDB lookup still works
2. **Statistics**: Real-time data from your database
3. **Pre-programmed Responses**: For common queries
4. **Department Info**: Hardcoded department details

### What Users See (Fallback Mode):
```
User: "Hello"
Bot: "Hello! I'm here to help you with the grievance redressal 
      portal. How can I assist you today?"

User: "Track GR518582ZTBEMB"
Bot: [Searches MongoDB and shows real complaint status]

User: "How many complaints?"
Bot: [Shows real statistics from database]
```

So your chatbot is **still functional** even without OpenAI credits!

## 🔧 Code Changes (Already Applied)

I've updated the chatbot to gracefully handle quota errors:

```typescript
// lib/chatbot-service.ts
try {
  const response = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({...});
  return response.choices[0]?.message?.content;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Chatbot OpenAI error:', error);
  // Automatically falls back to intelligent responses
  return this.getFallbackResponse(userMessage);
}
```
