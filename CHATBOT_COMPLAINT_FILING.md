# Chatbot Complaint Filing - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ Feature Implemented Successfully!

The chatbot now supports **conversational complaint filing** directly through the chat interface. Users can file complaints by simply chatting with the AI assistant.

---

## üéØ How It Works

### Conversation Flow

The chatbot uses a state machine to guide users through filing a complaint:

```
IDLE ‚Üí ASK_NAME ‚Üí ASK_EMAIL ‚Üí ASK_DEPARTMENT ‚Üí ASK_CATEGORY ‚Üí ASK_DESCRIPTION ‚Üí CONFIRM ‚Üí SUBMIT
```

### Steps

1. **Trigger Intent**: User says "I want to file a complaint" or similar phrases
2. **Collect Name**: Bot asks for full name (validates 2-100 characters)
3. **Collect Email**: Bot asks for email (validates format)
4. **Select Department**: Bot shows 8 department options (number or name)
5. **Select Category**: Bot shows 8 category options (number or name)
6. **Provide Description**: User describes complaint (10-2000 characters)
7. **Confirm**: Bot shows summary, user types "CONFIRM" or "CANCEL"
8. **Submit**: Complaint saved to MongoDB, tracking ID generated

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`lib/chatbot-service.ts`**
   - Added `ComplaintFilingState` enum
   - Added `ComplaintData` interface
   - Extended `ChatSession` with complaint state tracking
   - Added validation methods: `validateName()`, `validateEmail()`
   - Added `detectComplaintIntent()` to recognize filing requests
   - Added `handleComplaintFiling()` for state machine logic
   - Added `getComplaintData()` and `resetComplaintState()` helpers

2. **`app/api/chatbot/route.ts`**
   - Integrated complaint submission logic
   - Detects `SUBMIT_COMPLAINT` marker from service
   - Calls MongoDB to save complaint
   - Generates tracking ID using `generateTrackingId()`
   - Performs NLP analysis on description
   - Returns success message with tracking ID

### State Management

Session state is maintained in memory using the existing `Map<sessionId, ChatSession>` structure. Each session tracks:
- `complaintState`: Current step in the filing process
- `complaintData`: Collected information (name, email, department, category, description)

### Validation Rules

2. Healthcare
3. Transportation
4. Municipal Services
5. Police
6. Revenue
7. Agriculture
8. Environment

### Available Categories

1. Infrastructure
2. Service Delay
3. Quality Issue
4. Staff Behavior
5. Corruption
6. Safety Concern
7. Documentation
8. Other

## üìä Database Integration

### Complaint Record Created

When submitted, the following is saved to MongoDB:

```javascript
{
  trackingId: "GR518762XYZABC",
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  department: "Healthcare",
  category: "Service Delay",
  description: "I have been waiting for my medical test results...",
  status: "Pending",
  priority: "Medium",  // From NLP analysis
  dateFiled: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  sentiment: "neutral",  // From NLP analysis
  keywords: [],  // From NLP analysis
  urgency: 5,
  complexity: 5,
  tags: [],
  viewCount: 0,
  escalationLevel: 0
}
```

### Admin Dashboard

The filed complaint will immediately appear in:
- Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
- Tracking page (`/track/[trackingId]`)
- Statistics queries in chatbot

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Features

### Compatible With:
- ‚úÖ NLP analysis (sentiment, urgency, priority)
- ‚úÖ Tracking system (uses same tracking ID format)
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard (complaints appear immediately)
- ‚úÖ Email notifications (same flow as form submission)
- ‚úÖ MongoDB storage (identical schema)

### Intent Detection:
The chatbot can handle multiple intents simultaneously:

- General queries (AI-powered responses)

---

## üêõ Error Handling

### Graceful Failures:
1. **MongoDB Connection Error**: Falls back to error message, doesn't crash
2. **NLP Service Error**: Uses default values, continues submission
3. **Duplicate Tracking ID**: Retries up to 10 times with new IDs
4. **Invalid Session**: Creates new session automatically

---

- ‚úÖ Faster complaint filing (no form navigation)
- ‚úÖ Guided step-by-step process

5. üìß Test email notification (if configured)

---

## üí° Tips

### For Testing:
- Open browser console to see API calls
