## 🔍 Check Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) while testing:

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Flow Diagram:
```
User Types Message
       ↓
Chatbot Route (/api/chatbot)
       ↓
Connect to MongoDB
       ↓
Analyze Intent:
├─ Tracking ID? → Query Complaint by trackingId
├─ Statistics? → Count all complaints by status
├─ General? → Use AI with MongoDB context
└─ Fallback → Smart keyword-based response
       ↓
Return Response to User
```

### MongoDB Queries:
1. **Track Complaint:** `Complaint.findOne({ trackingId })`
2. **Statistics:** `Complaint.countDocuments({ status: 'Pending' })`
3. **Recent Context:** `Complaint.find().sort({ dateFiled: -1 }).limit(10)`

---

## 🎨 Features

### ✅ Smart Intent Detection
- Detects tracking ID patterns (GR + alphanumeric)
- Recognizes statistics queries
- Understands general help requests

### ✅ Real-Time Data
- Queries MongoDB on every request
- Always shows current status
- Up-to-date statistics

### ✅ Context-Aware AI (with OpenAI)
If you have `OPENAI_API_KEY` set:
- Uses last 10 complaints as context
- Provides intelligent, data-driven answers
- Learns from conversation history

### ✅ Works Without API Key
Even without OpenAI:
- Tracks complaints ✓
- Shows statistics ✓
- Provides help ✓
- Smart keyword responses ✓

---

## 🔐 Optional: Add OpenAI API Key

For even smarter responses, add to `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

**With API key**, the bot can:
- Answer complex questions about trends
- Provide recommendations
- Give personalized advice
- Understand context better

**Without API key**, the bot still:
- Tracks all complaints
- Shows statistics
- Provides help
- Works perfectly!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Chatbot doesn't respond

**Check:**
1. Is MongoDB connected? (Terminal should show "✓ Connected to MongoDB")
2. Is the app running? (http://localhost:3000 should work)
3. Browser console errors? (Press F12)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Restart the app
cd /Users/syedasif/COMPLAINT-RAISE-SYSTEM-main
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Can't find complaint"

**Verify:**
1. Tracking ID is correct (case-sensitive)
2. Complaint exists in MongoDB Atlas
3. Check spelling: GR518582ZTBEMB (not gr518582ztbemb)

### Issue: Generic responses only

**Cause:** OpenAI API key not set (totally fine!)

**Solution:** The bot works great without it using MongoDB data directly.
