## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Organized with Optgroups

The dropdowns now use `<optgroup>` tags for better organization:

```html
<select>
  <option value="">Select Department</option>
  
  <optgroup label="Public/Government Services">
    <option value="Education">Education</option>
    <option value="Healthcare">Healthcare</option>
    ...
  </optgroup>
  
  <optgroup label="Internal/Corporate">
    <option value="IT Support">IT Support</option>
    <option value="Human Resources">Human Resources</option>
    ...
  </optgroup>
</select>
```

**Benefits:**

  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  department: "IT Support",  // Can now be any of 13 options
  category: "Login / Access Issue",  // Can now be any of 15 options
  type: "Internal",  // Auto-set based on department
  status: "Pending",
  ...
}
```
