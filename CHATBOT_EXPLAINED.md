### Trigger Phrases for Auto-Escalation:

- "still not working"
- "still broken"
- "still having the problem"
- "not fixed"
- "didn't work"
- "no luck"
- "same issue"

### Skip Troubleshooting:

Users can skip directly to complaint filing by saying:
- "file a complaint"
- "log a complaint"
- "submit a complaint"

## 🆘 AI Quota Fallback System

### Scenario 1: OpenRouter API Quota Exceeded

```
USER: "My printer won't print"
SYSTEM: Attempts to use AI for troubleshooting
ERROR: 429 quota exceeded / rate limit

BOT: "⚠️ I'm currently experiencing high demand and unable to 
troubleshoot right now. Let me escalate this to our technical 
team instead.

I'll help you file a complaint so our team can investigate and 
resolve your issue.

What is your full name?"

ACTION: Automatically switches to complaint filing mode
DEPARTMENT: Auto-detected (IT Support)
TYPE: Internal
```

### Scenario 2: No OpenAI Key Configured

```
USER: "Network connection is down"
SYSTEM: No OpenAI key available

BOT: "⚠️ I'm unable to troubleshoot right now due to system 
limitations, but I can log this as a complaint for you.

Let me file this with our technical team. What is your full name?"

ACTION: Uses fallback troubleshooting responses or files complaint
```

### Scenario 3: Repeated AI Failures

```
ATTEMPT 1: AI fails → Use fallback response
ATTEMPT 2: AI fails → Use fallback response
ATTEMPT 3: AI fails → Auto-escalate to complaint

BOT: "I'm experiencing technical difficulties. Let me escalate 
this to ensure your issue gets resolved. What is your full name?"
```

---

## 📊 Complaint Type Classification

### Automatic Type Assignment:

```typescript
// Internal Departments → type: "Internal"
IT Support, Human Resources, Finance, Admin & Facilities, 
Technical Maintenance

// Public Departments → type: "Public"
Education, Healthcare, Transportation, Municipal Services, 
Police, Revenue, Agriculture, Environment
```

### In Database:

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "trackingId": "GR518762XYZABC",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "department": "IT Support",
  "category": "Login / Access Issue",
  "type": "Internal",  // ← Automatically set
  "status": "Pending",
  "priority": "Medium",
  "description": "Auto-escalated tech issue: I can't log into my email",
  ...
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

Result: ✅ Skips troubleshooting, goes straight to complaint filing
```

### Scenario 4: AI Quota Exceeded

```
User: "Computer is slow"
System: Attempts AI troubleshooting → 429 error
Bot: "⚠️ Experiencing high demand, escalating to technical team..."
Bot: "What is your full name?"
Result: ✅ Auto-escalates immediately, files complaint
```

### Scenario 5: Non-Tech Issue

```
User: "School bus late every day"
Detection: Not tech-related (Education dept)

## 🎨 User Experience Examples

### Example 1: Login Issue (Resolved)

```
User: I can't log into my account

Bot: 🔧 Troubleshooting Attempt 1 of 3

Let me help you with that login issue:

1. Check if Caps Lock is on
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies
3. Try the "Forgot Password" link to reset
4. Attempt login in an incognito/private window

Try these steps and let me know if you can log in.

User: Oh! Caps Lock was on. It works now!

Bot: Excellent! Glad that resolved it. Caps Lock catches 
everyone sometimes! 😊

Is there anything else I can help you with?
```

### Example 2: Printer Issue (Auto-Escalated)

```
User: Office printer is jammed and won't print

Bot: 🔧 Troubleshooting Attempt 1 of 3

Here's how to clear a printer jam:

1. Turn off the printer
2. Open all access doors and gently remove paper
3. Check for torn pieces left behind
4. Close doors and turn printer back on
5. Try a test print

Did this resolve the issue?

User: Still jammed, can't get the paper out

Bot: 🔧 Troubleshooting Attempt 2 of 3

Let's try a more thorough approach:

1. Unplug the printer completely
2. Remove the toner/ink cartridge
3. Look for hidden paper scraps
4. Check the paper tray for wrinkled sheets
5. Reassemble and test

Any improvement?

User: No, same problem

Bot: 🔧 Troubleshooting Attempt 3 of 3

This might need physical inspection:

1. Check if there's a jam indicator light
2. Consult the printer's manual for jam locations
3. Consider if professional service is needed

Let me know if you need further assistance.

User: Still not working, needs repair

Bot: 🔄 Auto-Escalating to Complaint System

I've tried to help resolve this issue 3 times, but it seems 
the problem persists. Let me escalate this to our 
Technical Maintenance team.

I'll help you file a formal complaint so our team can 
investigate and repair the printer.

Let's start by collecting some information.

First, what is your full name?

User: Sarah Johnson

Bot: Thank you, Sarah Johnson! What is your email address?

[... continues complaint filing ...]

Bot: ✅ Complaint Filed Successfully!

Your tracking ID is: GR751928KBCDEF

📋 Summary:

• Email: sarah.j@company.com
• Department: Technical Maintenance
• Category: Hardware / Device Problem
• Type: Internal
• Priority: Medium
• Description: Auto-escalated tech issue: Office printer 
  is jammed and won't print

Our Technical Maintenance team will review and respond soon.

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management:

```typescript
interface ChatSession {
  // Existing fields
  id: string;
  userId?: string;
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  complaintState?: ComplaintFilingState;
  complaintData?: ComplaintData;
  
  // NEW: Troubleshooting fields
  troubleshootCount?: number;        // 0-3, tracks attempts
  isInTroubleshooting?: boolean;     // Currently troubleshooting?
  troubleshootTopic?: string;        // Original issue description
  lastTroubleshootAttempt?: Date;    // Timestamp of last attempt
}
```

### Priority Routing Logic:

```
1. PRIORITY 1: Explicit complaint intent?
   → "I want to file a complaint"
   → Go to complaint filing (reset troubleshooting)

2. PRIORITY 2: Already in complaint filing?
   → Continue complaint filing flow

3. PRIORITY 3: Tech-related issue?
   → Start/continue troubleshooting
   → Check attempt count
   → Auto-escalate if count >= 3

4. DEFAULT: General conversation
   → Use AI or fallback responses
```

### Department Detection Algorithm:

```typescript
function detectDepartmentByKeyword(message: string): string | null {
  const lowerMessage = message.toLowerCase();
  
  // Check each department's keyword patterns
  if (matches IT keywords) return 'IT Support';
  if (matches HR keywords) return 'Human Resources';
  if (matches Finance keywords) return 'Finance';
  // ... etc
  
  return null; // Let user choose manually
}
```
